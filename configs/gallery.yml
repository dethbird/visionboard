Upon his activation they uploaded the occupation \"plumber\" into his main fucking memory.\nIn this world there are no humans around but somehow he always has a pipe to clean out or something to unclog. It's a very septic life. He tends to drink and do a lot of drugs, even on the job.\nBut he also has a stereotypically Italian lust for life, and he sings Opera to all the beautiful women ... robots. Women robots.\nThis piece is concept art for a mini film starring the one and only Beepo Beeparelli"
